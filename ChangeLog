 * MODIFIED: Make initialization/1 ISO compliant
   This patch is a modest cleanup to the implementation of '$load_file'/3
   from init.pl and provides an ISO compatible implementation of
   initialization/1. This executes the argument goal *after* loading the
   file rather than when encountering the directive. Often this makes no
   difference, but notably load_foreign_library/1 is an exception.
   Therefore we added use_foreign_library/1,2 that act as a directive and
   provides proper integration with saved-states automatically.  Loading
   code using initialization(load_foreign_library(...)) will load the
   library immediately and issue a warning.
   
   See initialization/1,2 for details and further hints for dealing with
   possible compatibility problems.
